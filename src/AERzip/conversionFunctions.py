def bytesToSpikesFile(bytes_data, initial_address_size, initial_timestamp_size, verbose=True):
    """
    Converts a bytearray of raw spikes of a-byte addresses and b-byte timestamps, where a and b are initial_address_size
    and initial_timestamp_size fields, respectively, to a SpikesFile of raw spikes of the same shape (or with 4-byte
    addresses or timestamps if a or b are equal to 3 bytes).

    This is the inverse function of the spikesFileToBytes function.

    :param bytearray bytes_data: The input bytearray. It must contain raw spikes data (without headers).
    :param int initial_address_size: An int indicating the size of the addresses in bytes_data.
    :param int initial_timestamp_size: An int indicating the size of the timestamps in bytes_data.
    :param boolean verbose: A boolean indicating whether or not debug comments are printed.

    :return: This function returns three different objects, listed below:
    - spikes_file (SpikesFile): The output SpikesFile object from pyNAVIS.
    - final_address_size (int): An int indicating the size of the addresses in the final SpikesFile.
    - final_timestamp_size (int): An int indicating the size of the timestamps in the final SpikesFile.

    .. notes:
        When input_options sizes are 3 bytes it is needed to work differently due to NumPy and Python does not support
        np.uint24 (or working with data types of 3 bytes). It cost more time that viewing the arrays as np.uint8 (1 byte),
        np.uint16 (2 bytes) or np.uint32 (4 bytes). When processing 3-byte addresses or timestamps, the returned
        SpikesFile will contain 4-byte addresses or timestamps to allow SpikesFile processing.

        Based on the above comment, there are two different cases that must be considered:

        1) If the input_options size fields are equal to 3 bytes, final_address_size and final_timestamp_size will be 4
        bytes.

        2) Otherwise, these will have the same value as in the input_options.

        Currently all compressed files use 4-byte addresses and timestamps except those which were compressing with the
        LZMA compressor. You can find more information about this in the spikesFileToCompressedFile function.
